        <summary>
            RDATE and EXDATE properties malfunction when using a time zone instead of UTC.
        </summary>

    <bug id="2" known="0.16" fixed="0.16">
        <summary>DURATION data types misbehave when parsing an iCalendar.</summary>
        <details>
            DURATION data types currently accept "full" durations, with day and time components,
            but reject a duration with only the day component (i.e. "-P2D").
            Also, DURATION data types are not automatically assigned when parsing
            a content line.

        <summary>Alarms will not trigger relative to the END of a component</summary>
        <details>
            Alarms are currently only able to trigger relative to the START date of a component,
            whereas it should be able to trigger relative to the START or END of the component.

        <summary>Calendar properties cannot have user-defined parameters</summary>
        <details>
            Calendar properties, such as PRODID, VERSION, CALSCALE, and METHOD, do not allow
            custom parameters to be used.  For example, PRODID;RELEASE=BETA:1.2

    <bug id="5" known="0.16" fixed="0.17">
        <summary>Calendar components do not directly have parameters associated with them</summary>
        <details>
            Calendar components, such as Event components, Todo components, etc. cannot have
            parameters directly associated with them.  The parameters are associated to the
            component via a ContentLine object, which is only populated when reading an iCalendar file;
            however, if generating an iCalendar from scratch, ContentLine objects are generally 
            unused.

    <bug id="6" known="0.17" fixed="0.17">
        <summary>A value-type is always specified for certain fields when serializing.</summary>
        <details>
            When certain fields are serialized, a VALUE parameter is always specified;
            however, most of these fields have a default value-type.  If the value
            is already of the default value-type, a VALUE parameter should not
            be specified.

    <bug id="7" known="0.17" fixed="0.17">
        <summary>When saving data to an .ics file, lines are not "folded" at 75 characters</summary>
        <details>
            As per RFC 2445, lines that exceed 75 characters in length should
            be "folded" by adding a line feed followed by a whitespace character.

    <bug id="8" known="0.17" fixed="0.17">
        <summary>Non-standard properties (X-properties) are not saved</summary>
        <details>
            When loading an iCalendar with non-standard properties, such as
            Apple iCal's "X-WR-" properties (X-WR-CALNAME, X-WR-TIMEZONE, etc.),
            they are discarded. Hence, when serializing, those properties are
            never re-serialized.

    <bug id="9" known="0.17">
        <summary>Special characters, such as 'รง' and other international characters are not parsed correctly.</summary>
        <details>
            Some international characters, such as 'รง' do not parse correctly.  The parsing engine
            does not allow these types of characters to be in Text fields.
