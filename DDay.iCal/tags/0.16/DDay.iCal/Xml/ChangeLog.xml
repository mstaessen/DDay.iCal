                <summary>Alarms do not trigger relative to the END of a component</summary>
                <details>
                    Alarms are currently only able to trigger relative to the START date of a component,
                    whereas it should be able to trigger relative to the START or END of the component.

                <summary>Fixed a bug that caused DURATION data types to misbehave when parsing an iCalendar.</summary>
                <details>
                    DURATION data types would accept "full" durations, with day and time components,
                    but would reject a duration with only the day component (i.e. "-P2D").
                    Also, DURATION data types would not be automatically assigned when parsing
                    a content line.

                    time zone instead of UTC.
